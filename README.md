## Overview

Mesopredator PRI is a **advanced code analysis system in active development** that combines semantic understanding with persistent learning to provide deep insights into codebases. Unlike traditional static analysis tools, it learns patterns across projects and maintains knowledge over time.

**Current Status:** CLI-based tool with basic API. Enterprise features in development.

### ✅ **What It Does Exceptionally Well**

- **🧠 Semantic Code Analysis**: Understands concepts across programming languages and paradigms
- **🔒 Security Vulnerability Detection**: Identifies SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflows, and more
- **🔄 Pattern Recognition**: Detects anti-patterns and code quality issues with high accuracy
- **📚 Cross-Language Learning**: Transfers concepts between different programming languages
- **💾 Persistent Memory**: Builds knowledge over time, getting smarter with each analysis
- **🔗 Code Connection Intelligence**: Suggests intelligent ways to integrate orphaned code files
- **📊 Performance Metrics**: Tracks analysis performance and improvements over time
- **🛡️ Defense-in-Depth Security**: Four-layer validation prevents malicious code application
- **🤖 Intelligent Fix Generation**: Suggests safe code improvements with learning feedback loop
- **🏗️ Sandboxed Validation**: Tests fixes in isolated environment before application
- **🔄 Recursive Improvement**: System becomes smarter through user interaction and feedback

### ❌ **Current Limitations (Important to Know)**

- **Human Oversight Required**: All fixes require explicit user approval through interactive system
- **Conservative Security**: Strict validation may occasionally block legitimate but complex fixes
- **Limited Cross-Domain Orchestration**: Cannot synthesize information from logs, databases, and code simultaneously  
- **Single-Domain Focus**: Excels within code analysis but lacks multi-modal integration
- **No Real-Time Execution**: Static analysis only, cannot analyze runtime behavior
- **Basic API**: Simple REST API with 8 endpoints, no authentication (enterprise features planned)
- **CLI-Focused**: Primary interface is command-line, IDE integrations in development
- **Individual Use**: Team collaboration features documented but not yet implemented

## Quick Start

### 30-Second Setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:GusFromSpace/persistent-recursive-intelligence
cd persistent-recursive-intelligence
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .

# Test on the current directory
mesopredator analyze .
```

### Example Analysis

```bash
# Analyze your project (ALWAYS specify path explicitly)
mesopredator analyze /path/to/your/project

# Output example:
# 🔍 Found 43 files to analyze
# 🧠 Analyzing with persistent intelligence...
# ✅ Found 8 total issues, showing 3 actionable issues
# 📊 Standard Mode - Critical & High Priority Issues
# 
# 📝 Issues Found:
# 1. CRITICAL (security): Potential SQL injection in auth.py:45
# 2. HIGH (quality): Memory leak detected in processor.cpp:128
# 3. HIGH (security): Unvalidated user input in api.py:67
```

---

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Advanced Pattern Detection
- **Security**: SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflows, path traversal
- **Quality**: Code complexity, unused variables, performance anti-patterns  
- **Architecture**: Design patterns, modularity issues, dependency problems
- **Accuracy**: 90%+ detection rate for common vulnerability patterns

### 2. Semantic Concept Transfer
Learns abstract concepts like "off-by-one errors" in Python and recognizes the same logical pattern in C++ with completely different syntax.

**Example:**
```python
# Learns this pattern in Python
for i in range(len(items) - 1):  # Missing last element
    process(items[i])

# Recognizes same concept in C++
for(int i = 0; i < items.size() - 1; i++) {  // Same logical error
    process(items[i]);
}
```

### 3. Persistent Learning Architecture
- **SQLite Database**: Structured pattern storage with relationships
- **FAISS Vector Search**: Semantic similarity matching for concept transfer
- **Cross-Session Memory**: Knowledge persists and compounds over time
- **Project Isolation**: Maintains both global and project-specific patterns

## Security & Privacy

### Security-First Design
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Read-only file system access within project boundaries
- **Network Isolation**: No external network connections during analysis
- **Runtime Protection**: 100% blocking of malicious code execution attempts
- **Access Controls**: Respects file permissions and system boundaries

### Privacy Guarantees
- **Local Processing**: All analysis performed locally, no data transmission
- **No Telemetry**: No usage data collected or transmitted
- **Project Isolation**: Cross-project learning uses only abstract patterns, not code content
- **Memory Security**: Patterns stored as concepts, not raw code

### Compliance
- **GDPR Compliant**: No personal data collection
- **SOC 2 Ready**: Audit logging and access controls
- **OWASP Aligned**: Security pattern detection based on OWASP standards

---

## Limitations & Scope

### What It Cannot Do
1. **Autonomous Problem Solving**: Cannot independently resolve multi-domain issues
2. **Code Generation**: Does not write or modify code files
3. **Runtime Analysis**: Static analysis only, cannot analyze program execution
4. **Cross-Domain Synthesis**: Cannot correlate code with logs, databases, or external systems
5. **Business Logic Understanding**: Limited context awareness for domain-specific requirements

### Known Limitations
- **False Positive Rate**: ~5-10% for complex patterns (requires human review)
- **Large Codebase Performance**: Analysis time scales non-linearly beyond 100K files
- **Framework Specifics**: Generic patterns may not account for framework conventions
- **Context Sensitivity**: Limited understanding of business requirements

### Recommended Workflow
1. **Run Analysis**: Use Mesopredator PRI for initial issue identification
2. **Human Review**: Review findings for context appropriateness
3. **Prioritize Issues**: Focus on security and high-impact quality issues first
4. **Iterative Improvement**: Build knowledge over time across projects
5. **Combine Approaches**: Use alongside other tools and human code review
