Strategic Development Path
Immediate Priority (Deployment):

Deploy the system in its current, validated state.

Craft the USER_MANUAL.md and public-facing documentation to be honest and precise about its capabilities, emphasizing its strengths in analysis and security while clearly stating the current limitations in autonomous orchestration.

Continue the "Marathon" test as a long-term benchmark for performance and stability.

Next Architectural Evolution (The Orchestrator):

Research & Design: Begin architectural planning for a cross-domain correlation engine. This new layer would ingest structured analysis results from the existing modules (e.g., "N+1 pattern detected in file.py," "Slow response time for /endpoint in logs," "Schema for table has foreign key to other_table").

Goal: The new engine's primary function would be to find meaningful relationships between these disparate findings to build a root cause hypothesis, effectively solving the problem presented in ADV-TEST-006.

Phased Approach:

Phase 1: Build the engine to correlate just two domains (e.g., code and logs).

Phase 2: Expand to three or more domains.

Phase 3: Develop a "solution synthesis" component that proposes multi-part fixes based on the correlated analysis.
