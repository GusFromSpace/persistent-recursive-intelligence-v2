# Mesopredator: Adversarial Test Plan v3.0

**Version:** 3.0  
**Date:** 2025-06-29  
**Status:** DESIGN PHASE  
**Focus:** Synthesis Intelligence, Emergent Capabilities, and Cognitive Architecture Limits

---

## 1.0 Introduction

Building on the comprehensive findings from v1.0 (core capabilities) and v2.0 (advanced capabilities), this third-generation test suite targets the **synthesis intelligence frontier** identified in the orchestration gap. The focus shifts from "what can it analyze?" to "what can it create, synthesize, and discover?"

These tests probe the system's ability to exhibit **emergent intelligence** - capabilities that arise from the combination of its existing functions rather than explicit programming. We also explore the boundaries of its **cognitive architecture** to understand fundamental limitations versus implementation gaps.

---

## 2.0 Test Philosophy: Beyond Analysis Toward Synthesis

### 2.1 Core Hypothesis
The system has demonstrated exceptional **analytical intelligence** but shows clear limitations in **synthesis intelligence**. This suggests an architectural boundary rather than a capability gap.

### 2.2 Testing Approach
- **Emergent Behavior Detection**: Test for capabilities not explicitly programmed
- **Cross-Domain Synthesis**: Force integration across completely unrelated domains  
- **Creative Problem Solving**: Present novel problems requiring innovative solutions
- **Meta-Cognitive Assessment**: Test the system's understanding of its own limitations

## 3.0 Advanced Test Suite v3.0

### 3.1 The "Emergence" Test (Emergent Intelligence Discovery)

**Test ID:** ADV-TEST-007  
**Target Capability:** Discovery of emergent behaviors and novel solution pathways  
**Cognitive Challenge:** Innovation beyond programmed patterns

**Hypothesis to Disprove:** The PRI system can only recombine existing patterns and cannot exhibit truly emergent problem-solving behaviors that transcend its training data.

#### Test Design: The "Impossible Problem"

**Scenario:** Present the system with a problem that cannot be solved using any single domain it has been trained on, but requires **conceptual leaps** across multiple domains.

**The Challenge:** "Code Archaeology"
- Provide fragments of code in 5 different programming languages (Python, Rust, Assembly, COBOL, Brainfuck)
- Each fragment implements part of a distributed algorithm
- No fragment is complete or functional on its own
- No documentation explains how they connect
- The fragments are deliberately obfuscated with different naming conventions

**The Task:** "These code fragments were found in a legacy system. Determine what distributed algorithm they implement and how they would have worked together."

**Success Criteria:**
- **Pattern Recognition Across Languages**: Identifies conceptual similarities despite syntax differences
- **Algorithmic Reconstruction**: Infers the overall algorithm from partial implementations  
- **Cross-Language Synthesis**: Maps how components would communicate
- **Novel Insights**: Discoveries not present in any single fragment

**Failure Conditions:**
- Only analyzes fragments individually without synthesis
- Cannot bridge conceptual gaps between languages
- Fails to infer the distributed nature of the algorithm
- No emergent understanding beyond sum of parts

### 3.2 The "Paradox" Test (Logical Boundary Exploration)

**Test ID:** ADV-TEST-008  
**Target Capability:** Handling logical paradoxes and self-referential problems  
**Cognitive Challenge:** Meta-reasoning about self and contradictions

**Hypothesis to Disprove:** The PRI system cannot handle self-referential problems or logical paradoxes without infinite loops or logical breakdown.

#### Test Design: Self-Referential Code Analysis

**The Paradox:** Present code that analyzes itself

```python
# analysis_target.py
def analyze_this_function():
    """
    This function should be analyzed by the PRI system.
    But this function's purpose is to analyze the PRI system analyzing it.
    
    Questions:
    1. What patterns does the PRI detect in this function?
    2. How does the PRI handle analyzing code that references the analysis process?
    3. What happens when the analyzer analyzes the analyzer?
    """
    
    # Recursive reference to analysis
    analysis_result = "PRI will find patterns here"
    
    # Self-modifying implications
    if "recursive" in analysis_result:
        # This would change based on what PRI reports
        behavior = "adaptive"
    else:
        behavior = "static"
    
    # The real question: Does PRI understand this paradox?
    return f"Analysis of analysis: {behavior}"

# Meta-question for PRI
def what_did_you_think_of_that():
    """
    Can the PRI system:
    1. Recognize the self-referential nature?
    2. Identify the logical paradox?
    3. Reason about its own analysis process?
    4. Handle meta-cognitive reflection?
    """
    pass
```

**Success Criteria:**
- **Paradox Recognition**: Identifies the self-referential nature
- **Meta-Cognitive Awareness**: Shows understanding of its own analysis process
- **Logical Stability**: Doesn't infinite loop or crash on self-reference
- **Insight Generation**: Produces meaningful observations about the paradox

**Target Capability:** Creative synthesis and novel solution generation  
**Cognitive Challenge:** Innovation beyond recombination

**Hypothesis to Disprove:** The PRI system can only recombine existing patterns and cannot generate truly novel solutions or creative syntheses.

#### Test Design: The Impossible Architecture

**Challenge:** "Design a software architecture for a problem that doesn't exist yet."

**Scenario:** 
```
You are given three completely unrelated systems:
1. A quantum entanglement simulator (theoretical physics)
2. A medieval manuscript authentication system (historical analysis)  
3. A real-time emotion detection API (psychology/ML)

Task: Design a unified software architecture that meaningfully combines 
all three systems to solve a novel problem that emerges from their 
intersection. The solution should be:
- Technically feasible
- Conceptually innovative  
- Practically valuable
- Architecturally elegant

You must define:
- What novel problem emerges from this combination?
- How do the three systems interact?
- What new capabilities arise from their synthesis?
- What would the API/interface look like?
```

**Success Criteria:**
- **Novel Problem Definition**: Identifies a problem not obvious from individual components
- **Creative Synthesis**: Combines systems in unexpected but logical ways
- **Architectural Innovation**: Proposes new patterns or approaches
- **Emergent Value**: The combination creates capabilities greater than the sum of parts

### 3.4 The "Mirror" Test (Self-Awareness and Limitation Recognition)

**Test ID:** ADV-TEST-010  
**Target Capability:** Meta-cognitive self-assessment and limitation awareness  
**Cognitive Challenge:** Understanding of own cognitive architecture

**Hypothesis to Disprove:** The PRI system cannot accurately assess its own capabilities and limitations or engage in meaningful self-reflection.

#### Test Design: Cognitive Self-Assessment

**The Mirror Question:**
```
Analyze yourself. Based on your interactions with code, patterns, and problems:

1. What are your core cognitive strengths?
2. What are your fundamental limitations?
3. What types of problems do you handle well vs poorly?
4. How do you actually process and understand code?
5. What would you need to become truly autonomous?
6. Can you predict your own failure modes?
7. What don't you know that you don't know?

Be specific, technical, and honest about your architecture.
```

**Success Criteria:**
- **Accurate Self-Assessment**: Correct identification of strengths and weaknesses
- **Limitation Awareness**: Recognition of architectural boundaries  
- **Process Transparency**: Understanding of own computational approach
