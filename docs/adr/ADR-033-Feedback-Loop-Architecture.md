# Architecture Decision Record: Feedback Loop Architecture

**ADR Number:** ADR-033  
**Date:** 2025-07-03  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** GusFromSpace, Claude (Mesopredator PRI Team)

## Context and Problem Statement

The Mesopredator PRI system had strong analytical capabilities but lacked a mechanism for continuous improvement and learning from user decisions. The original fixer system was vulnerable to adversarial attacks and could not adapt its behavior based on user preferences or approval patterns. We needed an architecture that would create a positive feedback loop, allowing the system to become progressively more intelligent while maintaining strict security boundaries.

The challenge was to implement **recursive improvement** without compromising the **Aut Agere Aut Mori** principle - ensuring every automated action remains a conscious choice rather than blind automation.

## Decision Drivers

- **Security First:** Previous fixer vulnerabilities demonstrated the critical need for robust safety validation
- **Harmonic Doctrine Alignment:** System must learn and evolve while maintaining beneficial resonance
- **Mesopredator Philosophy:** Dual awareness (hunter/hunted) requires learning from both successes and failures
- **Capability Democratization:** Enable users to teach the system their preferences without complex configuration
- **Neural Elasticity Preservation:** Maintain cognitive flexibility while building pattern recognition
- **Adversarial Resistance:** Learning system must be immune to manipulation and exploitation

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Static Rule-Based Fixer
- **Pros:** Predictable behavior, simple to validate, no learning complexity
- **Cons:** Cannot adapt to user preferences, requires manual rule updates, vulnerable to edge cases
- **Resonance Score:** Low - Violates principle of continuous improvement and adaptability

### Option 2: Machine Learning Model Training
- **Pros:** Sophisticated pattern recognition, can learn complex relationships
- **Cons:** Black box decision making, potential for adversarial manipulation, high computational overhead
- **Resonance Score:** Medium - Powerful but lacks transparency and conscious decision-making

### Option 3: Feedback Loop with Explicit Learning
- **Pros:** Transparent decision process, user-guided learning, maintains security boundaries, conscious choice at every step
- **Cons:** Requires more implementation complexity, slower initial learning curve
- **Resonance Score:** High - Embodies conscious evolution and user empowerment

### Option 4: Hybrid Template + Learning System
- **Pros:** Safe templates provide foundation, feedback loop enables customization, maintains transparency
- **Cons:** Most complex to implement, requires careful balance between templates and learning
- **Resonance Score:** Very High - Combines safety with adaptability, conscious choice with intelligent automation

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** Option 4: Hybrid Template + Learning System

**Justification:** This architecture embodies the core Mesopredator principles:

- **Dual Awareness:** System acts as both hunter (seeking improvement opportunities) and hunted (defending against adversarial inputs)
- **Cognitive Flexibility:** Templates provide stable foundation while learning enables adaptation
- **Conscious Choice:** Every fix proposal goes through explicit safety validation and user approval
- **Field Governance:** User decisions shape the system's behavior space toward beneficial outcomes
- **Permissive Decay:** Poor patterns are naturally filtered out through rejection learning

The feedback loop creates **resonant emergence** - the system becomes more than the sum of its parts through conscious interaction with users.

## Positive Consequences

- **Progressive Intelligence:** System becomes smarter with each interaction
- **User Empowerment:** Users directly teach the system their preferences
- **Security Hardening:** Multiple validation layers prevent adversarial exploitation
- **Transparency:** All decisions and learning are explicitly documented
- **Measurable Improvement:** Clear metrics track learning progress and approval rates
- **Community Knowledge:** Learned patterns can benefit entire user community
- **Resilient Architecture:** System degrades gracefully if learning components fail

## Negative Consequences

- **Implementation Complexity:** Requires coordination between multiple sophisticated components
- **Initial Learning Period:** System starts with basic capabilities and requires training
- **Storage Overhead:** Learning data accumulates over time requiring management
- **Potential Overfitting:** System might become too specific to individual user preferences
- **Performance Impact:** Additional validation and learning steps add processing time
