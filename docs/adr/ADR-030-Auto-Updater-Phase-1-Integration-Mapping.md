# ADR-030: Auto-Updater Phase 1 - Integration Mapping System

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-07-01  
**Deciders:** GusFromSpace, Claude  
**Technical Story:** Transform Mesopredator from strategic coordinator to creative architect

## Context

Following the success of the Code Connector system (ADR-028, ADR-029), we identified the need for a complete Auto-Updater pipeline that can not only suggest intelligent code connections but also safely execute them. The challenge was building a system that can:

1. **Analyze multi-file update packages** with complex internal dependencies
2. **Generate comprehensive integration plans** with safety guarantees
3. **Execute modifications automatically** while preserving system integrity
4. **Provide rollback capabilities** to prevent data loss

This represents the evolution from "box of building blocks" analysis to complete automated integration.

## Decision

We implement a comprehensive Auto-Updater system with four integrated phases:

### Phase 1: Code Connector Analysis
- **Purpose**: Identify orphaned files and generate connection suggestions
- **Technology**: Enhanced Code Connector with metrics collection
- **Input**: Update package files + target project files
- **Output**: Ranked connection suggestions with confidence scores

### Phase 2: Update Package Analysis  
- **Purpose**: Analyze package structure and internal dependencies
- **Technology**: Multi-file dependency analysis with role classification
- **Key Features**:
  - Package role detection (core, utility, config, test, documentation)
  - Internal dependency graph construction
  - External requirement identification
  - Optimal integration order computation
- **Output**: Complete package integration plan

### Phase 3: Integration Map Generation
- **Purpose**: Create detailed, executable integration plans
- **Technology**: Step-by-step modification planning with safety analysis
- **Key Features**:
  - Granular modification planning (import_add, function_call, config_update)
  - Risk assessment (safe, caution, review_required)
  - Rollback plan generation
  - Time estimation and complexity scoring
- **Output**: Comprehensive integration map ready for execution

### Phase 4: Automated Patching
- **Purpose**: Safe execution of integration maps with full rollback capabilities
- **Technology**: Atomic file operations with comprehensive safety validation
- **Key Features**:
  - Project backup creation before any modifications
  - Interactive approval system integration
  - Real-time validation at each step
  - **Safe rollback mechanism** (file-by-file restoration)
  - Comprehensive execution logging and metrics

## Architecture Components

### Update Package Analyzer
```python
class UpdatePackageAnalyzer:
    - analyze_update_package() -> PackageIntegrationPlan
    - _analyze_package_structure() -> PackageDependencyGraph
    - _build_internal_dependency_graph()
    - _compute_integration_order() -> List[str]
```

**Key Innovation**: Multi-file dependency analysis that understands package cohesion and generates optimal integration sequences.

### Integration Map Generator  
```python
class IntegrationMapGenerator:
    - generate_integration_map() -> IntegrationMap
    - _generate_integration_steps() -> List[IntegrationStep]
    - _create_file_modifications() -> List[FileModification]
    - _assess_integration_risk() -> str
```

**Key Innovation**: Detailed step-by-step planning with safety classification and comprehensive rollback planning.

### Automated Patcher
```python
class AutomatedPatcher:
    - execute_integration_map() -> Dict[str, Any]
    - _create_project_backup() -> bool
    - _execute_integration_steps() -> bool
    - _rollback_execution() -> bool  # CRITICAL: Safe file-by-file restoration
```

**Key Innovation**: Atomic operations with safe rollback that prevents catastrophic data loss.

## Safety Architecture

### Critical Safety Fix Applied
**Problem**: Original rollback mechanism used `shutil.move(self.project_path, temp_current)` which could delete entire project directories when `self.project_path` was `.` (current directory).

**Solution**: Implemented file-by-file restoration:
```python
def _rollback_execution(self, context: ExecutionContext) -> bool:
    # Get list of files that were backed up
    backed_up_files = []
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(backup_path):
        for file in files:
            full_path = Path(root) / file
            rel_path = full_path.relative_to(backup_path)
            backed_up_files.append(rel_path)
    
    # Restore each file individually
    for rel_path in backed_up_files:
        backup_file = backup_path / rel_path
        target_file = self.project_path / rel_path
        target_file.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
        shutil.copy2(backup_file, target_file)
```

### Multi-Layer Safety Validation
1. **Pre-execution validation**: Project state, file existence, backup creation
2. **Step-by-step validation**: Syntax checking, import validation, permission verification
3. **Post-execution validation**: Comprehensive system integrity checks
4. **Interactive approval**: User oversight for all modifications
5. **Atomic operations**: All-or-nothing execution with automatic rollback

## Performance Metrics
