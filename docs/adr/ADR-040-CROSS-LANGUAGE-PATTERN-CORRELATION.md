# Architecture Decision Record: Cross-Language Pattern Correlation

**ADR Number:** 040  
**Date:** 2025-07-04  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** GusFromSpace, Claude (Mesopredator Intelligence)

## Context and Problem Statement

While ADR-017 established Lua language analysis capabilities, polyglot codebases need cross-language pattern correlation to identify systemic issues and share solutions between languages. The OpenMW semantic integration project combines Python AI systems with Lua game scripting, requiring intelligence that understands relationships between language-specific implementations of similar patterns.

Current limitation: Language analyzers operate in isolation, missing opportunities to:
- Correlate security patterns across Python and Lua
- Share performance optimization insights between scripting languages
- Identify architectural inconsistencies in multi-language systems
- Learn from solutions implemented in one language to improve another

## Decision Drivers

- **Mesopredator Philosophy**: Dual awareness requires seeing both opportunities (cross-language solutions) and threats (systemic vulnerabilities)
- **Capability Democratization**: Enable developers to benefit from patterns learned across entire ecosystem
- **Harmonic Doctrine**: Restore coherence across polyglot codebases, not just individual languages
- **Memory Intelligence**: Leverage FAISS to correlate patterns without duplicating storage
- **Read-Only Principle**: Scan other language databases without modifying them
- **Temporal Patience**: Allow pattern correlation to emerge naturally through usage

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Separate Language Analysis (Status Quo)
- **Pros:** Simple, isolated, no cross-contamination
- **Cons:** Misses systemic patterns, duplicates effort, no learning transfer
- **Resonance Score:** Low - violates interconnected intelligence principle

### Option 2: Unified Language Database
- **Pros:** Single source of truth, easy correlation
- **Cons:** Language-specific patterns get mixed, performance issues, complex maintenance
- **Resonance Score:** Low - loses language-specific optimization

### Option 3: Read-Only Cross-Language Correlation
- **Pros:** Maintains language isolation while enabling correlation, FAISS-efficient, no data pollution
- **Cons:** More complex search logic, potential false correlations
- **Resonance Score:** High - preserves autonomy while enabling synthesis

### Option 4: Event-Driven Pattern Propagation
- **Pros:** Real-time correlation, efficient updates
- **Cons:** Complex messaging, potential cascade failures, tight coupling
- **Resonance Score:** Medium - reactive rather than conscious choice

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** Read-Only Cross-Language Correlation (Option 3)

**Justification:** This embodies the Mesopredator principle of "hunter awareness" - scanning the environment (other language databases) for patterns while maintaining predator independence (never modifying other territories). The read-only approach preserves each language's semantic integrity while enabling cross-pollination of insights.

## Positive Consequences

- **Pattern Learning Transfer**: Security patterns from Python inform Lua analysis
- **Systemic Issue Detection**: Architectural problems visible across language boundaries
- **Solution Adaptation**: Performance optimizations from one language suggest approaches for another
- **Memory Efficiency**: FAISS vector search enables correlation without data duplication
- **Language Autonomy**: Each analyzer maintains independent pattern storage
- **Emergent Intelligence**: Cross-language insights emerge from accumulated analysis sessions

## Negative Consequences

- **Search Complexity**: Multiple search strategies required for effective correlation
- **False Correlations**: Similar terms may not represent actual pattern relationships
- **Performance Overhead**: Cross-language searches add computational cost to analysis
- **Initial Cold Start**: Correlation quality depends on accumulated patterns in memory

## Implementation Plan

- [x] **Phase 1:** Extend BaseLanguageAnalyzer with cross-language search capabilities
- [x] **Phase 2:** Implement search_cross_language_patterns() with multiple query strategies
- [x] **Phase 3:** Add analyze_with_cross_language_context() for enriched analysis
- [x] **Phase 4:** Integrate correlation into LuaAnalyzer with semantic synthesis
- [x] **Phase 5:** Test cross-language correlation on OpenMW Python-Lua integration
- [ ] **Phase 6:** Extend to additional languages (JavaScript, C++, Rust)
- [ ] **Monitoring:** Track correlation accuracy and false positive rates
- [ ] **Rollback Plan:** Disable cross-language correlation via configuration flag

## Validation Criteria

*How will we know if this decision was correct?*
- Cross-language correlations provide actionable insights for multi-language projects
- Security patterns detected in Python inform Lua security analysis
- Performance optimizations transfer knowledge between scripting languages
- OpenMW semantic character development benefits from Python AI pattern insights
- Memory usage remains efficient despite cross-language searching
- Developer feedback indicates correlation insights are valuable, not noise

## Technical Architecture

**Core Components:**
```python
BaseLanguageAnalyzer:
  - search_cross_language_patterns(query, limit) -> Dict[str, List[Dict]]
  - analyze_with_cross_language_context(file_path) -> Dict
  - get_cross_language_correlations() -> List[str]

LuaAnalyzer:
  - _analyze_cross_language_patterns(local_issues) -> List[Dict]
  - _generate_cross_language_recommendation(issue_type, cross_patterns) -> str
```

**Search Strategy:**
1. Primary: `{language}_pattern_{query}`
2. Secondary: `{language}_pattern {query}`
3. Tertiary: `{query} {language}`
4. Fallback: `{query}` (generic search)

**Memory Architecture:**
- Each language maintains independent pattern storage
- FAISS enables efficient cross-database vector search
- Read-only access prevents pattern contamination
- Results filtered by relevance to maintain correlation quality

## Cross-Language Family Relationships

**Scripting Family:** Python ↔ Lua ↔ JavaScript ↔ Ruby
- Error handling patterns (try/except ↔ pcall ↔ try/catch)
- Performance optimizations (list comprehensions ↔ table operations)
- Security patterns (credential exposure, injection vulnerabilities)

**Systems Family:** C++ ↔ Rust ↔ C ↔ Go
- Memory management patterns
- Concurrency and threading approaches
- Performance-critical optimization strategies

**Managed Family:** Java ↔ C# ↔ Kotlin ↔ Scala
- Object-oriented design patterns
- Type safety and error handling
- Framework and library usage patterns
