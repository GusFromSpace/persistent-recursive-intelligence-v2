**ADR Number:** 010  
**Date:** 2025-06-24  
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED & VALIDATED  
**Deciders:** Development Team  
**Technical Story:** First demonstration of compound intelligence learning across multiple AI projects

## 🎯 **Context and Problem Statement**

We successfully deployed the memory-enhanced PRI system across four different AI projects to validate compound intelligence effects in real-world scenarios. This represents the first practical demonstration of an AI system that learns from multiple projects and accumulates intelligence across different codebases.

**Research Question:** Does the memory-enhanced PRI system demonstrate compound intelligence effects when analyzing multiple, diverse AI projects sequentially?

**GUS Principle Applied:** *Compound Intelligence* - Intelligence that accumulates and multiplies across different projects rather than analyzing each in isolation.
