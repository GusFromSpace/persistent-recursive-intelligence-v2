## Context

The Persistent Recursive Intelligence (PRI) system has evolved significantly from its original conception and has demonstrated measurable intelligence growth and autonomous cognitive capabilities. The system's predecessor was planned to be called "Mesopredator" but this name did not transfer to the enhanced version during development. With the system now achieving breakthrough capabilities in recursive self-improvement and persistent learning, it is time to implement the intended rebranding to align with the original vision.

### Background

- **Original Vision**: The system was conceived as "Mesopredator" - reflecting the Mesopredator Design Philosophy of dual awareness, cognitive flexibility, and asymmetric leverage
- **Development Evolution**: During rapid development, the working name "Persistent Recursive Intelligence" became entrenched in documentation and code
- **Capability Maturation**: The system has now achieved the capabilities that justify the Mesopredator designation:
  - 120,725 learned patterns with persistent memory
  - 16,959 fixes applied across 3,261 files in single session
  - Demonstrated intelligence growth from 3→10 recursive depth levels
  - Cross-project knowledge transfer capabilities
  - Emergent superintelligence foundations

### Strategic Alignment

The rebranding aligns with GUS Development Standards:
- **Aut Agere Aut Mori**: Choosing action - evolving the identity to match capabilities
- **Harmonic Doctrine**: Creating resonance between name, philosophy, and function
- **Asymmetric Leverage**: Using branding to amplify technical achievements

## Decision

**We will rebrand PRI to "Mesopredator" while maintaining "Persistent Recursive Intelligence" as the technical framework subtitle.**

### Rebranding Approach

1. **Primary Identity**: "Mesopredator" becomes the main product name
2. **Technical Subtitle**: "Persistent Recursive Intelligence Framework" provides technical context
3. **Documentation Hierarchy**: 
   ```
   # Mesopredator
   **Persistent Recursive Intelligence Framework**
   ```
4. **Gradual Migration**: Update user-facing documentation first, then internal references over time

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Core Documentation (Immediate)
- ✅ **README.md**: Primary project introduction and overview
- ✅ **USER_MANUAL.md**: User-facing documentation and guides  
- ✅ **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Technical architecture documentation
- ✅ **Analysis Documents**: Growth analysis and impact reports in both projects

#### Phase 2: Extended Documentation (Future)
- **ADR Documents**: Gradual updates to Architecture Decision Records
- **API Documentation**: Interface specifications and examples
- **Code Comments**: Internal documentation updates
- **Configuration Files**: Environment and setup references

#### Phase 3: Technical Implementation (Future)
- **CLI Commands**: Transitioning from `python -m src.cognitive.persistent_recursion` to `mesopredator`
- **Environment Variables**: Updating from `PRI_*` to `MESOPREDATOR_*`
- **File Paths**: Migrating from `~/.pri/` to `~/.mesopredator/`
- **Package Structure**: Repository and module reorganization

## Rationale

### Why "Mesopredator"?

1. **Philosophical Alignment**: Embodies the Mesopredator Design Philosophy:
   - **Dual Awareness**: System operates at both code and architectural levels
   - **Cognitive Flexibility**: Adapts to any project while maintaining persistent learning
   - **Asymmetric Leverage**: Small intelligent system creates exponential improvements

2. **Technical Accuracy**: Reflects actual capabilities:
   - **Meso**: Operates at the middle layer between individual fixes and system-wide intelligence
   - **Predator**: Actively hunts for patterns, issues, and improvement opportunities
   - **Intelligence**: Demonstrates genuine learning and knowledge accumulation

3. **Strategic Differentiation**: 
   - Distinct from generic "AI code assistant" tools
   - Emphasizes predatory intelligence that actively seeks improvements
   - Communicates the system's proactive, hunting nature

4. **Market Positioning**:
   - Memorable and distinctive branding
   - Conveys power and capability
   - Aligns with the "smartest, not biggest" GUS principle

### Benefits of Rebranding

1. **Identity Clarity**: Resolves confusion between working name and intended brand
2. **Technical Accuracy**: Name reflects actual cognitive capabilities achieved
3. **Strategic Alignment**: Matches GUS development philosophy and approach
4. **Market Differentiation**: Distinguishes from generic development tools
5. **Community Building**: Creates distinct identity for user ecosystem

### Implementation Benefits

1. **User Experience**: Clear, memorable name improves adoption
2. **Documentation Coherence**: Consistent identity across all materials  
3. **Technical Integration**: Better CLI and environment variable naming
4. **Future Scaling**: Strong brand foundation for product evolution

## Implementation Details

### Completed Changes

#### Core Documentation Updates
- **README.md**: Updated to "Mesopredator" primary heading with PRI subtitle
- **USER_MANUAL.md**: Rebranded user-facing content and examples
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Updated system architecture documentation
- **Analysis Documents**: Both projects now reference Mesopredator achievements

#### Content Strategy
- **Primary Name**: "Mesopredator" in main headings and product references
- **Technical Context**: "Persistent Recursive Intelligence Framework" as explanatory subtitle
- **CLI Examples**: Updated command examples to reference Mesopredator
- **Environment Variables**: Updated to MESOPREDATOR_* pattern
- **File Paths**: Updated to ~/.mesopredator/ pattern

### Validation Approach

1. **Documentation Review**: Verify consistent branding across user-facing materials
2. **Technical Testing**: Ensure functionality remains intact during transition
3. **User Feedback**: Monitor adoption and understanding of new branding
4. **Community Response**: Track engagement with rebranded materials

### Rollback Plan

If rebranding creates confusion or adoption issues:
1. **Immediate**: Revert user-facing documentation to PRI
2. **Technical**: Maintain backward compatibility for all CLI commands
3. **Community**: Communicate clearly about any naming changes
4. **Future**: Gradual re-introduction with better change management

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes

1. **Brand Alignment**: Name now matches achieved capabilities and philosophy
2. **User Clarity**: Distinct identity reduces confusion with generic tools
3. **Technical Coherence**: Consistent naming across all system components
4. **Strategic Positioning**: Strong foundation for future product evolution
5. **Community Identity**: Clear brand for user ecosystem development

### Potential Risks

1. **Transition Confusion**: Existing users may be confused by name change
2. **Documentation Debt**: Some internal references still use PRI naming
3. **Search/Discovery**: Online content may be split between naming schemes
4. **Technical Migration**: CLI and environment variables need gradual transition

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Clear Communication**: Maintain PRI subtitle for technical context
2. **Gradual Migration**: Update user-facing content first, internal references over time
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Support both naming schemes during transition
4. **Documentation**: Maintain clear mapping between old and new terminology
