# Architecture Decision Record: Lua Language Analyzer Integration

**ADR Number:** 039  
**Date:** 2025-07-04  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** GusFromSpace, Claude (Mesopredator Intelligence)

## Context and Problem Statement

The Mesopredator PRI system has been Python-centric, limiting its ability to analyze multi-language codebases. With the OpenMW semantic integration project using Lua extensively, we need to extend PRI's analysis capabilities to support Lua language patterns, OpenMW-specific constructs, and cross-language correlations.

The current limitation prevents proper analysis of:
- OpenMW Lua API usage patterns
- Lua-specific performance anti-patterns
- Security vulnerabilities in Lua scripts
- Cross-language integration issues between Python AI systems and Lua game logic

## Decision Drivers

- **Capability Democratization**: Enable professional-grade Lua analysis without requiring specialized tools
- **OpenMW Integration**: Support semantic character development with proper code analysis
- **Multi-Language Architecture**: Establish foundation for analyzing polyglot codebases
- **Pattern Recognition**: Leverage PRI's memory intelligence for Lua-specific patterns
- **Mesopredator Philosophy**: Dual awareness of opportunities (better code) and threats (vulnerabilities)
- **Harmonic Doctrine**: Restore coherence across the entire codebase, not just Python components

## Considered Options

### Option 1: External Lua Linter Integration
- **Pros:** Leverage existing tooling (luacheck, selene)
- **Cons:** No memory intelligence, no OpenMW patterns, external dependency
- **Resonance Score:** Low - violates self-contained intelligence principle

### Option 2: Lua-Specific Analyzer Module
- **Pros:** Custom patterns, OpenMW awareness, memory integration, extensible
- **Cons:** More development effort, maintenance burden
- **Resonance Score:** High - aligns with conscious intelligence and capability democratization

### Option 3: Generic AST Parser
- **Pros:** Could support multiple languages eventually
- **Cons:** Complex implementation, no immediate OpenMW benefit
- **Resonance Score:** Medium - future-oriented but delays immediate value

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** Lua-Specific Analyzer Module (Option 2)

**Justification:** This embodies the Mesopredator principle of building targeted intelligence that serves immediate needs while establishing extensible architecture. The analyzer integrates with PRI's memory system, enabling pattern learning across sessions - a key differentiator from static analysis tools.

## Positive Consequences

- **Immediate Value**: OpenMW semantic characters can be analyzed and improved
- **Memory Intelligence**: Lua patterns persist across sessions, improving over time
- **OpenMW Specialization**: Custom patterns for console commands, engine handlers, performance optimization
- **Multi-Language Foundation**: Establishes the Multi-Language Support Standard architecture
- **Cognitive Preservation**: Maintains developer understanding while providing AI assistance

## Negative Consequences

- **Maintenance Burden**: Additional analyzer to maintain and update
- **Learning Curve**: Team must understand Lua-specific patterns and OpenMW constructs
- **Initial Pattern Seeding**: Memory database starts empty, requiring pattern accumulation

## Implementation Plan

- [x] **Phase 1:** Create LuaAnalyzer class following Multi-Language Support Standard
- [x] **Phase 2:** Implement OpenMW-specific pattern detection (console commands, engine handlers)
- [x] **Phase 3:** Integrate with recursive_improvement_enhanced.py
- [ ] **Phase 4:** Test on OpenMW semantic characters project
- [ ] **Phase 5:** Expand pattern database based on real-world usage
- [ ] **Monitoring:** Track pattern detection accuracy and false positive rates
- [ ] **Rollback Plan:** Disable multi-language support flag if issues arise

## Validation Criteria

*How will we know if this decision was correct?*
- Lua files are properly analyzed with OpenMW-specific patterns detected
- Memory intelligence accumulates useful patterns over time
- OpenMW semantic character development is accelerated
- No performance degradation in Python-only analysis
- Pattern correlation between Python AI logic and Lua game logic emerges

## Technical Architecture

The implementation follows the Multi-Language Support Standard:

```
src/
├── cognitive/
│   └── enhanced_patterns/
│       └── base_analyzer.py          # Language registry
└── language_analyzers/
    └── lua_analyzer.py               # Lua-specific patterns
```

**Key Components:**
- `BaseLanguageAnalyzer`: Abstract interface for language-specific analysis
- `LanguageAnalyzerRegistry`: Central registry for multi-language support
- `LuaAnalyzer`: Lua-specific implementation with OpenMW patterns
- Memory integration for persistent pattern learning
