# Architecture Decision Record: Manual Fix Detection in PRI Cycle Tracker

**ADR Number:** 017  
**Date:** 2025-06-25  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** Development Team, PRI Enhancement Initiative

## Context and Problem Statement

PRI's improvement cycle tracker was only detecting automated fixes applied through its own processes. However, developers frequently apply manual fixes between scans, and these valuable learning opportunities were being lost. The system needed to detect when issues disappeared from subsequent scans, indicating manual intervention, and incorporate this data into the learning cycle.

## Decision Drivers

- **Learning Completeness:** Need to capture both automated and manual improvement patterns
- **Automation Opportunities:** Manual fix patterns reveal where automation could be valuable
- **Cycle Accuracy:** Incomplete cycles (where issues vanish) were creating data gaps
- **User Behavior Insights:** Understanding manual intervention patterns helps optimize the system
- **Memory System Leverage:** Existing memory architecture provides foundation for cross-scan comparison
- **Metrics Integration:** Existing metrics system enables quantitative analysis of fix patterns

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Simple Issue Count Comparison
- **Pros:** 
  - Easy to implement
  - Low computational overhead
  - Provides basic manual fix detection
- **Cons:**
  - Cannot identify specific fixes
  - No learning from manual patterns
  - Limited automation opportunity identification
- **Resonance Score:** Low - misses the cognitive flexibility principle by not adapting to patterns

### Option 2: Content Hash Comparison
- **Pros:**
  - More precise than count comparison
  - Can detect exact issue resolution
  - Relatively straightforward
- **Cons:**
  - Fragile to minor changes in reporting
  - No context awareness
  - Limited pattern learning capabilities
- **Resonance Score:** Medium - provides awareness but lacks adaptability

### Option 3: Semantic Issue Signature with Memory Integration
- **Pros:**
  - Leverages existing memory system architecture
  - Robust cross-scan comparison via issue signatures
  - Enables pattern learning and automation recommendations
  - Integrates with existing metrics system
  - Provides detailed insights for optimization
- **Cons:**
  - More complex implementation
  - Higher computational requirements
  - Requires careful signature design
- **Resonance Score:** High - embodies dual awareness (automated + manual) and cognitive flexibility

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** Semantic Issue Signature with Memory Integration

**Justification:** This option embodies the Mesopredator principles by maintaining dual awareness of both automated and manual improvement patterns while demonstrating cognitive flexibility through adaptive learning from manual intervention patterns. It leverages PRI's existing memory architecture rather than building isolated functionality, maintaining system coherence.

## Positive Consequences

- **Complete Learning Cycles:** All improvement cycles now reach completion, whether through automation or manual intervention
- **Automation Roadmap:** Clear identification of patterns suitable for automation based on manual fix frequency
- **Enhanced Metrics:** Comprehensive tracking of manual vs automated fix rates and effectiveness
- **Pattern Recognition:** System learns from human decision-making patterns
- **User Feedback Loop:** Manual fixes become implicit training data for the system
- **Memory System Utilization:** Leverages existing infrastructure for maximum efficiency

## Negative Consequences

- **Implementation Complexity:** Requires careful issue signature design and cross-scan correlation logic
- **Performance Impact:** Additional memory queries and signature comparison operations
- **Signature Brittleness:** Risk of false positives/negatives if signature algorithm is not robust
- **Memory Growth:** Additional cycle tracking data increases memory storage requirements

## Implementation Plan

- [x] **Phase 1:** Implement issue signature creation and cycle comparison logic
- [x] **Phase 2:** Add manual fix detection and cycle completion methods
- [x] **Phase 3:** Integrate pattern analysis and automation opportunity identification
- [x] **Phase 4:** Add CLI commands for manual fix tracking and analysis
- [ ] **Monitoring:** Track detection accuracy and false positive rates
- [ ] **Rollback Plan:** Can disable manual fix detection while maintaining existing cycle tracking

## Validation Criteria

*How will we know if this decision was correct?*
- **Detection Accuracy:** >90% accuracy in identifying actual manual fixes vs false positives
- **Learning Effectiveness:** Measurable improvement in automation recommendations based on manual fix patterns
- **User Adoption:** Regular usage of manual fix analysis CLI commands
- **Cycle Completion Rate:** >95% of improvement cycles reach completion status
- **Performance Impact:** <10% increase in memory query times
- **Review Timeline:** 30-day review to assess accuracy and adoption
