# OpenMW Integration Separation Complete

**Date:** 2025-07-04  
**Status:** Successfully Separated âœ…

## Summary

The OpenMW semantic integration has been successfully separated from the Mesopredator PRI project into its own dedicated repository structure.

## Migration Results

### Files Migrated: 72
- **Python Scripts:** 28 files (bridges, analyzers, utilities)
- **Lua Scripts:** 7 files (NPC AI, semantic APIs)
- **C++ Bindings:** 1 file
- **Databases:** 5 semantic DB files
- **JSON Data:** 31 metadata and report files
- **Documentation:** 3 markdown files

### New Project Location
```
/home/gusfromspace/Development/openmw-semantic-integration/
```

### Remaining Items
- `openmw_analysis/` - OpenMW source clone (manual decision required)
- `openmw_metrics_integration/` - OpenMW build (manual decision required)
- `cleanup_openmw_files.sh` - Can be removed after verification

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - PRI remains focused on code analysis
   - OpenMW integration can evolve independently

2. **Improved Project Clarity**
   - Each project has a single, well-defined purpose
   - Easier onboarding for contributors

3. **Better Performance**
   - Smaller codebases for analysis tools
   - Reduced complexity in each project

4. **Independent Development**
   - Teams can work on each project without conflicts
   - Different release cycles possible

## Next Steps for OpenMW Integration

1. **Set up GitHub repository** for the separated project
2. **Update import paths** in migrated Python files
3. **Create proper CI/CD pipeline**
4. **Test all functionality** in new location
5. **Update documentation** with new repository links

## PRI Project Status

The Mesopredator PRI project is now clean of OpenMW-specific code and can continue its development as a focused code analysis tool with persistent learning capabilities.
